  A Simple summary goes here.
abstract: |
  A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, 
  abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage
  authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without 
  headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and
  highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main
  methods or treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main 
  findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. 
  The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not 
  contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and 
  should not exaggerate the main conclusions.
